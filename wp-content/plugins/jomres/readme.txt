This plugin contains the software required to install and run Jomres in Wordpress. Install it and this plugin will automate the rest of the installation for you. 

> Purchase a download and support license to download **any** of our Quickstarts, which are full copies of the demos and will get you up and running with a full site in just minutes.

[Installation guide](http://www.jomres.net/manual/installation-and-upgrading/10-installing-on-wordpress/8-installation-into-wordpress)

Jomres Core is free as in beer. If you want to enhance it's functionality through some of the many available plugins, or want support for it we encourage you to investigate the services we offer, but Jomres Core is free and not crippled in any way.

== Upgrade Notice ==



= 9.3.0 =

Added new availability calendars, which are improved and tidied up versions of the older calendars. These babies are much easier to maintain than the older code. Existing MRP and SRP calendars will be left in-place as we're aware that site users have made significant use of the older calendars and simply removing them will potentially detrimentally affect these users on upgrade. Delivering both side-by-side for a period of time will give those users a chance to change their code to take advantage of the new, improved ones.
Added new control panel statistics to give admins and managers a better overview of how their business is performing. Same new functionality has been added to the frontend for Property Managers, but with property specific stats.
Added functionality that allows us to limit which optional extras to show in the booking form, based on room types of rooms already selected in the same form.
Added a feature to allow extra services to have quantities ( mainly as a feature request from Marhinio ).
Added functionality to partner handling, now users who're marked as partners will make new guests in properties that they make bookings for. They will also be able to view these invoices in their own invoice list.

== Translations ==

* Jomres includes 31 language files in varying states of translation as we rely on members to feed back their versions of the language files. It includes a [variety of methods for translation](http://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide/53-customising-jomres/editing-labels-languages) allowing you to have different labels for different property types, and even individual properties.

*Note:* If you would like to contribute a language file back to the project please email us at sales@jomres.net, typically an update to a language file will earn you between 1-6 months added to your license, depending on the amount of translation that was required to bring the language file up-to-date.

== Post Installation recommendations ==

The Jomres developers are big fans of Bootstrap 3. It's a responsive CSS and Javascript framework that's easy to learn yet offers a great deal of flexibility, flexibility that you will appreciate as you customise the site for your clients or yourselves.

We recommend that the first thing you do is find a Bootstrap 2 or 3 Wordpress template that you like and install that on your site. Next, go to Jomres' Site Configuration area and set "Use Jomres Bootstrap templates in the frontend?" to Yes and set "Bootstrap version" to Bootstrap 2 or 3.

This will ensure that your WP template and the Jomres templates play nicely together.
